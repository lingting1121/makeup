Makeup application is a cloud api platform. The apis perform CRUD operations on different products in the store and user can add and delete or edit the items. Also can view the items by performing the CRUD functions. 

Functionality:
User can query the apis that are hosted online and perform the crud functions. The user is able to get data and post it through the apis and then search an item by its id. After searching the item is added to the cassandra live database and user can see and view it.

Apis for adding products to the database are written, deleting the product based on its item id and then editing the product based on its id.

External Api:
I used the makeup apis from the website http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com. I can update the name, brand which im only considering maybelline for now and description and its price.
