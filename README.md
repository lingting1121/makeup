#Cloud Computing Store Application
Cloud Computing app is a cloud based application, the application performs CRUD operations on different items in the store.

When a user scans a new item, the information is fetched from the online database that has the information on it. User can add a new item or delete items that are present in the store.

The CRUD operations are performed on the data in the database

Functionality:
I have made a mobile application that is allowing user to query the apis that are hosted online and perform the crud fucntions. The user is able to signup and login through the application and then search an item. After searching the item is added to the cart of the application and user can see and view it.

Apis for adding products to the database are written, deleting the product based on its item id and then editing the product based on its item id.
Apart from the signup and signin apis, user can get the product from the live database that is hosted and he can see the live prices which are available on walmarts external api.

External Api:
I have used walmarts external api for my project and im using it to update the name, description and the prices of the items i have in my product database.
Link to the walmarts apis are https://developer.walmartlabs.com/io-docs.

server that is being used is http://35.230.147.105 for the apis.
